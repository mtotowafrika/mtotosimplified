            A cornerstone of empowerment, fostering financial literacy and community support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Established in 2023, this group provides a vital platform for 25 women, 15 Malaika girls, and 3 boys, totaling 43 members, to collectively save, access credit, and receive crucial financial literacy training. Through their dedication, the group has collectively saved an impressive average of 9,000,000 UGX annually. This remarkable achievement is built on weekly savings and individual interest generation, demonstrating their commitment to self-sufficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite challenges arising from the diverse composition of the group, our unwavering commitment is to uplift every single member, mirroring the transformative support Mtoto W'afrika provides to the entire community.

God is so good for giving us a loving boss (Samuel and his team) in Kampala who really works hard, hand in hand with the team on the ground. Thank you for your transparency, accountability, and continuous support. We pray that God bless our organization so that we do greater things. I know we can."
