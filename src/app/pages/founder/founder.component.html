    From Vulnerability to Purpose: My Journey
  </h3>
  <p>
    Growing up in the slums of Kampala, Uganda, I knew what it meant to
    struggle. Born in the early 80s, I was given birth to by a young girl who
    had dropped out of school due to fees. My early life was marked by poverty,
    hunger, and neglect. Despite the challenges, I found solace in
    <b>Eden Revival Church</b> and their literacy program, which became a
    turning point in my life.
  </p>
  <h3 class="founder-section-title">Discovering My Passion</h3>
  <p>
    Through my involvement with the <b>African Children's Choir</b>, I
    discovered my passion for helping vulnerable children. The choir's mission
    to share the love of Christ and hope with the world resonated deeply with
    me. I realized that I wasn't alone in my struggles and that there were
    others who needed help and support.

  <h3 class="founder-section-title">Pursuing My Calling</h3>
  <p>
    After touring with the choir, I was given full sponsorship to pursue my
    education. I trained in <b>Mass Communication</b>, which not only equipped
    me with skills but also transformed me into a community social worker. This
    training enabled me to effectively advocate for children's rights and
    support vulnerable communities.
