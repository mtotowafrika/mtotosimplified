## From Vulnerability to Purpose: My Journey

Growing up in the slums of Kampala, Uganda, I knew what it meant to struggle. Born in the early 80s, I was given birth to by a young girl who had dropped out of school due to fees. My early life was marked by poverty, hunger, and neglect.  

Despite the challenges, I found solace in **Eden Revival Church** and their literacy program, which became a turning point in my life.  

> *“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”*  
> *(Jeremiah 29:11)*  

These words resonated deeply with me, and I knew that God had a purpose for my life.

## Discovering My Passion

Through my involvement with the **African Children's Choir**, I discovered my passion for helping vulnerable children. The choir's mission to share the love of Christ and hope with the world resonated deeply with me.  

I realized that I wasn't alone in my struggles and that there were others who needed help and support.  

> *“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”*  
> *(Jeremiah 1:5)*  

I believe that God had a plan for me, and my experiences in the choir were a crucial part of that plan.

## Pursuing My Calling

After touring with the choir, I was given full sponsorship to pursue my education. I trained in **Mass Communication**, which not only equipped me with skills but also transformed me into a community social worker.  

This training enabled me to effectively advocate for children's rights and support vulnerable communities.

> *“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”*  
> *(Romans 8:28)*  

I believe that God is working all things together for good, and I'm honored to be a part of His plan.
